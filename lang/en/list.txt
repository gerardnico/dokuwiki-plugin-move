====== Move Pages of the current namespace ======

This plugin allows you to move selected pages of the current namespace with the following restriction:

  * You must have edit permission for the current page/all pages in the current namespace.
  * The pages that are moved must not be locked for editing.
  * For moving a page you also need create permission in the target namespace.
  * You cannot move a page to a namespace where a page with the same name already exists.

All links to and from the pages that are moved will be updated to reflect the new location and/or name.

<wrap warning>The images that are moving along are not the image of the current namespace but the images of the pages.</wrap>
